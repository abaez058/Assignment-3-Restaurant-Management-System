The Restaurant Management System (RMS) is a C-based program designed to simulate the management of a restaurant’s menu and order operations. It demonstrates key systems programming concepts such as pointer arithmetic, function pointers, string manipulation, and modular programming.

The system supports up to 10 menu items, each with a name, category, and price. Users can:

Add new menu items safely using boundary checks.

Search for items by name using a pointer-based linear search.

Calculate total prices and process orders using pointer arithmetic.

Sort the menu dynamically by price, name, or category using function pointers for flexible comparison strategies.

Ensure data consistency and robust error handling through null-pointer checks and loop protection macros.
